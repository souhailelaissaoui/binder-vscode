	* Dockerfile: Add networkx pygraphviz pydot pyyaml to base notebook

	* Dockerfile: This is a little after-the-fact documentation. We had enabled
	the LSP (language server protocol) extension for JupyterHub

	https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp/issues/200 for more
	information. Until that is fixed, we've disabled this.
